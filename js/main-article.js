                            <p class="article-content-text">I try and do something at the same time each day so that it becomes routine. </p>
                            <p class="article-content-text">The key difference with Scrimba is that you are writing code from day 1 so you are always getting to put into practice what you are learning. That definitely helps when you are doing a long course, as it would get very boring just watching videos.</p>
                            <h2 class="article-content-header">What are the key benefits of the bootcamp</h2>
                            <p class="article-content-text">For me the main benefits of the bootcamp so far have been the additional solo projects. I think I have built more than 15 already so I am constantly getting to use the skills I have been learning.</p>
                            <p class="article-content-text">And on the back of that getting all of these code reviewed by a mentor. Each one of these gives you tips for taking into your next project so you are constantly improving. Its also good to know that you are on the correct path with things, and any bad habits are picked up straight away</p>
