                <p class="about-me-content">After years of being a Backend Developer, I've decided to start the Bootcamp to learn Frontend and hopefully start working on both sides. I love learning new things</p>

                <p class="about-me-content">I love travelling and I guess that ties in with the learning journal as part of that I like learning about new cultures. My avatar is a picture of me in Bolivar Square in Bogotá. The best £2 I ever spent! My favourite city is New York (I have been many times but running the marathon was my best experience!), but I have recently been to Buenos Aires and that runs it close. I am going again this year so maybe it will overtake it, haha.</p>

                <p class="about-me-content">Before starting the bootcamp I had been learning Spanish for 4 years. I had burned myself out with that a bit so the Bootcamp is filling the void for a few months whilst I rediscover my motivation :) It needs to be quick as I am going to Argentina in a few months!</p>
